Chaewon’s profile was removed from Woollim Entertainment, fueling speculation that she had also signed with HYBE. In March 2022, it was confirmed that Sakura, Chaewon, and Huh Yunjin were part of the new group, LE SSERAFIM, which would debut in May. The group’s name, revealed through a 72-hour countdown, was an anagram of IM FEARLESS. The group’s members were revealed in early April 2022, starting with Sakura, followed by the others. Their debut song snippets and exclusive content were shared, and 120,000 digital souvenirs sold out during the project."
